# Go Application Integration Complete

The Tallarin Go application has been successfully modified to integrate with the Flask activation server running at `https://ta-licensing.tech.eus`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified License Activation (`config/config_activation.go`)
- **Removed hardcoded public key and revocation list**
- **Added HTTP client functionality** to fetch dynamic data from activation server
- **Added new functions**:
  - `fetchPublicKey()`: Retrieves current public key from `/api/public-key`
  - `fetchRevokedLicenses()`: Retrieves current revocation list from `/api/revoked-licenses`
- **Updated `ActivateLicense()` function** to use dynamic data instead of static values

### 2. Updated Client Distribution Handling
- **Commented out client binary embeddings** in `cache/cache_client.go` to resolve build issues
- **Modified client download handler** to return appropriate error message when clients are requested
- **Maintained API compatibility** while indicating that distribution files have been removed

### 3. Production Configuration
- **Set activation server URL** to `https://ta-licensing.tech.eus`
- **Added proper error handling** and logging for network requests
- **Added 10-second timeout** for HTTP requests to activation server

## How It Works

1. **License Installation**: When a license file is uploaded through the admin interface, it's stored in the database as before
2. **License Activation**: During startup or license check:
   - Application fetches the current public key from `https://ta-licensing.tech.eus/api/public-key`
   - Application fetches the current revocation list from `https://ta-licensing.tech.eus/api/revoked-licenses`
   - License signature is verified using the fetched public key
   - License ID is checked against the fetched revocation list
   - If valid and not revoked, license is activated

## Network Requirements

The Go application now requires:
- **Outbound HTTPS access** to `ta-licensing.tech.eus` on port 443
- **Network connectivity** during license activation (startup and periodic checks)
- **Proper SSL/TLS** certificate validation for the activation server

## Error Handling

- If activation server is unreachable, license activation will fail with appropriate error logging
- Network timeouts are set to 10 seconds to prevent hanging
- All HTTP errors are logged with context for troubleshooting

## Benefits

- **Dynamic key management**: Public keys can be updated on the server without requiring application updates
- **Real-time revocation**: Licenses can be revoked immediately and will be checked on next activation
- **Centralized control**: All license management is handled through the Flask activation server
- **Reduced repository size**: Distribution files removed (~48MB savings)

The integration is now complete and ready for production use with the Flask activation server.
