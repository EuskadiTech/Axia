<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This is the documentation for deploying and operating the Axia application platform. It assumes some knowledge for the target infrastructure (Windows Server or Linux). Once running, administrators can deploy Axia applications from online or local repositories in infrastructures with or without internet access.</p>
<h1 id="deployment-models">Deployment models</h1>
<p>Depending on the available IT infrastructure and how Axia is to be used, different deployment models exist:</p>

<p>If you intend to build your own Axia applications, it is good practice to build Axia applications with one system and then deploy to another for production. This way, users are only affected once applications are tested and ready. Especially the portable &amp; Docker versions can quickly be installed on PCs for building applications.</p>
<h2 id="dedicated">Dedicated</h2>
<p>The most common deployment option. Axia is installed on an application server (Windows or Linux), connecting to a separate database system.</p>
<h2 id="stand-alone">Stand-alone</h2>
<p>This option is available on Windows Server only. The stand-alone deployment has almost no external dependencies and comes with its own database. It is the recommended model for organizations with small IT teams.</p>
<h2 id="portable">Portable</h2>
<p>For development and test instances - the portable version of Axia can be started on Windows clients without any setup. Like the stand-alone model, the portable version comes with its own database. It is not recommended to run anything productive from a portable instance.</p>
<h2 id="docker">Docker</h2>
<p>For development and test instances - a <a href="https://tech.eus/t4/downloads.php">Docker Compose file</a> is available to quickly spin up a Axia instance. This file is not configured for productive use however. To run Axia productively with Docker, you can use the provided files as templates and adjust them to your environment. More details on the <a href="https://github.com/EuskadiTech/tallarin">repository page</a>.</p>
<h1 id="technical-requirements">Technical requirements</h1>
<h2 id="server">Server</h2>
<p>To run Axia the following requirements must be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating system (one of them)
<ul>
<li>Linux (tested on Debian, NixOS and Ubuntu Server)</li>
<li>Windows Server 2016 or later</li>
<li>Windows 10 or later (portable version)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Processor
<ul>
<li>Intel, AMD or ARM processors (x64 or ARM64), multiple cores provide better performance</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Memory
<ul>
<li>4+ GB</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Disk space
<ul>
<li>500 MB for Axia itself</li>
<li>20+ GB for the database and file uploads (scales with use)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Software
<ul>
<li>Linux server
<ul>
<li>Optional: ImageMagick (for thumbnails)</li>
<li>Optional: Ghostscript (for PDF thumbnails)</li>
<li>Optional: PostgreSQL client tools (for integrated backups)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Windows Server
<ul>
<li>Required: Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 (or newer)</li>
<li>Optional: Ghostscript (for PDF thumbnails)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Databases (dedicated deployment only)
<ul>
<li>PostgresSQL database (13.0 or newer), UTF8 encoded, with full permissions</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="clients">Clients</h2>
<p>To access a running Axia instance, any modern browser can be used, like Firefox, Chrome or Safari. This includes mobile browsers. Axia uses modern web standards; it does not support <code>Internet Explorer</code>.</p>
<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
<h2 id="on-windows-server">On Windows Server</h2>
<p>Axia comes with a graphical installer for Windows Server. The installer supports both <a href="#stand-alone">stand-alone</a> and <a href="#dedicated">dedicated</a> deployment models.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#stand-alone">Stand-alone</a>: After following the installer, Axia can be started immediately.</li>
<li><a href="#dedicated">Dedicated</a>: After the installation, database connection details for an empty, UTF8 encoded <a href="#preparing-a-new-postgresql-database">PostgreSQL database</a> (13.0 or newer) must be entered into the configuration file <code>config.json</code>. The file <code>config.json</code> is located inside the chosen application directory. The database user must have full permissions for the chosen database.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you plan to run Axia behind a proxy, please make sure to disable client timeouts for websockets. More details <a href="#proxies">here</a>.</p>
<p>Independent of deployment model, Axia is handled as a Windows service and can be started with the service manager (command: <code>services.msc</code>). Axia will write to the Windows application log, should the service not start correctly.</p>
<p>Because of licensing terms, we cannot distribute Ghostscript with Axia. If you want to create PDF thumbnails, you have to install a current version of Ghostscript on the Axia server.</p>
<h2 id="on-a-linux-server">On a Linux server</h2>
<p>For Linux servers, Axia is available as a compressed archive with pre-compiled binaries. The installation steps are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Extract the Axia archive file to a location of your choice (<code>/opt/rei3/</code> for example).</li>
<li>Make the file <code>r3</code> executable (<code>chmod u+x r3</code>).</li>
<li>Copy the file <code>config_template.json</code> to <code>config.json</code> - keep it in the same directory as the <code>r3</code> executable.</li>
<li>Add connection details to an empty, UTF8 encoded <a href="#preparing-a-new-postgresql-database">PostgreSQL database</a> (13.0 or newer) to <code>config.json</code>. The database user must have full permissions for the chosen database.</li>
<li>Optional: Install ImageMagick and Ghostscript if you want to have thumbnails (<code>sudo apt install imagemagick ghostscript</code>).</li>
<li>Optional: Install PostgreSQL client tools if you want to use the integrated backup feature (<code>sudo apt install postgresql-client</code>).</li>
<li>Register Axia with your service manager (<code>sudo ./r3 -install</code>).</li>
<li>Start the Axia service (<code>systemctl start rei3</code> for example).</li>
</ol>
<p>If you plan to run Axia behind a proxy, please make sure to disable client timeouts for websockets. More details <a href="#proxies">here</a>.</p>
<p>If the service does not start, Axia writes to <code>syslog</code>.</p>
<h1 id="first-access-to-rei3">First access to Axia</h1>
<p>When running, Axia is by default reachable on port 443. You can use any modern browser to access Axia locally at <code>https://localhost/</code> or from the network, given a configured firewall. During installation, a single admin user is created; username and password are both 'admin'.</p>
<p>After login, an admin user can access the admin panel to manage users, install applications, access system logs and so on. The default password should be changed immediately.</p>
<h1 id="configuration">Configuration</h1>
<p>Axias core configuration can be changed within its configuration file (<code>config.json</code>), which is located in the chosen Axia installation directory. Setting file paths, web server port and database connection details is straightforward - for an explanation of all settings <a href="#configuration-file">see here</a>. Changes are applied when the application service restarts.</p>
<h2 id="ssl-certificates">SSL certificates</h2>
<p>During installation, Axia creates a self-signed certificate to allow encrypted access to the application. It is not recommended to keep this certificate. If at all possible, a properly signed certificate should be provided for Axia to ensure secure communication with trust between clients and server.</p>
<p>Some common considerations / pitfalls:</p>
<ul>
<li>Axia can work with different certificates. If Axia cannot load a certificate, it will fail to start and log to the operating system (<code>syslog</code> for Linux, Windows application log otherwise).</li>
<li>Make sure that the hostname that the certificate is set to, is the same as clients use to connect to the Axia server. The port is irrelevant.</li>
<li>When running Axia internally (not reachable from the cloud), clients still need to be able to verify the certificate. Make sure that your certificate file (*.crt) includes all certificates up the chain until the one that is known to the clients - this is usually a trusted root or intermediary certificate.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="proxies">Proxies</h2>
<p>When clients talk to a Axia server, they use two methods - both are running on the same port via TCP:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTP(S) requests to load files, images and other web resources.</li>
<li>A continuous Websocket connection for data exchange between server and client. If this connection breaks down, the client tries to re-establish it.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to proxy servers (regardless of forward or reverse proxy), HTTP(s) requests can be handled like any other web application. So good-practices such as request timeouts are sensible.</p>
<p>Websockets however are meant to stay active until either side (server or client) purposefully closes the connection. When configuring a proxy, request timeouts or max. session time for Websocket connections should be disabled or at least set to multiple hours. Some proxies (like HAProxy) call these connections 'tunnel'. Every time a Websocket connection is forcefully closed by a proxy, the client must re-connect and can loose unsaved changes.</p>
<p>In case of <a href="#clustering-and-system-performance">cluster-setups</a>, a Websocket connection must 'stick' with one particular server until it´s closed. Even if the initial requests are assigned via round-robin, a particular server is responsible for ongoing Websocket communication with a specific client. HTTP(S) requests can however be handled by any cluster server at any time.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-file">Configuration file</h2>
<p>These are the settings inside the Axia configuration file <code>config.json</code> for reference:</p>
<ul>
<li>db: Database connection settings.
<ul>
<li>host: Database host to connect to. Can be a hostname or network address.</li>
<li>port: Database host port to connect to. Postgres runs on 5432 by default.</li>
<li>name: Database name to connect to. Axia requires a user with full permissions to this database. To prepare a new database for Axia <a href="#preparing-a-new-postgresql-database">follow this guide</a>.</li>
<li>user: Database user name to connect with.</li>
<li>pass: Database user password to connect with.</li>
<li>ssl: Connect to database host via SSL. Only works if database host supports SSL.</li>
<li>sslSkipVerify: If 'ssl' is active, ignore if the provided SSL cannot be verified by the Axia host system. This allows for an encrypted database connection even if the given certificate is untrustworthy.</li>
<li>connsMin: Minimum number of database connections to keep open. If set to 0, Axia will choose a number.</li>
<li>connsMax: Maximum number of database connections that can be used. Limiting this can be useful if Axia is running on a shared database system. Axia should at least have 4 DB connections to itself. If set to 0, Axia will choose a number.</li>
<li>embedded: If true, Axia starts its own internal database. True for stand-alone and portable deployments. When set to false, Axia connects to an external database server.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>web: Webserver settings.
<ul>
<li>cert/key: Names of certificate &amp; key files for Axia to offer HTTPS. If files do not exist, Axia will create a self-signed certificate &amp; key when started in HTTPS mode.</li>
<li>listen: Network address to listen on. If set to 0.0.0.0, Axia will listen for requests regardless of target address.</li>
<li>port: Network port to listen on. If set to 0, a free port will be assigned by the operating system on service start.</li>
<li>tlsMinVersion: The minimum TLS version Axia should accept from clients. Allowed values: "1.1", "1.2", "1.3"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>paths: Paths where files/directories relevant to Axia´s operation are located.
<ul>
<li>certificates: Certificates for the Axia webserver component (see 'web'-&gt;'cert' &amp; 'web'-&gt;'key').</li>
<li>embeddedDbBin: Only relevant for portable/stand-alone deployments. Binary files for embedded Postgres database system.</li>
<li>embeddedDbData: Only relevant for portable/stand-alone deployments. Data files for embedded Postgres database system.</li>
<li>files: Files uploaded to Axia for storage in attributes of the type 'files'. Contents is cleaned regularly by scheduled tasks when references are removed or file retention is satisfied.</li>
<li>fileExport / fileImport: Only relevant if file export/import functions are needed by Axia applications. Directories from which Axia can export/import files to/from. Must be accessible to the Axia server (or nodes if cluster setup). For security reasons, the Axia server can only use these directories for export/import tasks.</li>
<li>temp: Files uploaded temporarily to Axia for various operations. CSV uploads, application imports, etc. Contents is cleaned regularly by scheduled tasks.</li>
<li>transfer: Files uploaded to Axia for application installation or update. Files are kept to enable future export of dependencies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>mirror: Disables writing connectors (currently: email &amp; REST) as well as integrated backups. Useful for Axia instances that should mirror production systems for testing or development.</li>
<li>portable: Only relevant for portable deployments. If true, Axia will start in HTTP mode and open a browser to the Axia start page.</li>
<li>cluster: Cluster settings.
<ul>
<li>nodeId: The ID assigned to this cluster node. Should not be filled by hand. Axia will auto-generate and store a new node ID when a node first connects to a cluster.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="general-administration">General administration</h1>
<p>After configuration, basically all administrative tasks are executed via the admin user interface inside the main Axia web application. Any user defined as 'admin' has full access to these features.</p>
<h2 id="maintenance-mode">Maintenance mode</h2>
<p>To execute deep system changes safely, a separate operation mode is available, called 'maintenance mode'. When enabled, all non-admin users are automatically logged off from the system; new logins are also rejected from non-admin users.</p>
<p><img src="en_us_admin_pics/maintenance_mode.webp" alt="Maintenance mode" /></p>
<p>In maintenance mode, applications may be installed, configured and deleted. Please be aware that deleting applications will permanently delete all corresponding data from the system. This is irreversible without current, functional backups.</p>
<h2 id="builder-mode">Builder mode</h2>
<p>When the maintenance mode is active, Builder mode can also be enabled. This gives admin users access to the integrated, graphical application builder utility, called 'Builder' for short. The Builder is a powerful tool. All Axia applications are exclusively created and changed via the Builder.</p>
<p><img src="en_us_admin_pics/builder_mode.webp" alt="Builder mode" /></p>
<p>Please be aware that changing applications has permanent consequences up to and including data loss. Do not attempt to use the Builder in any productive instance. For testing or developing applications, a separated instance should be used. The portable version makes this easy on Windows clients. On Linux a separated application service, accessing a separate database, serves the same purpose.</p>
<h2 id="authentication-and-authorization">Authentication and authorization</h2>
<p>To manage user access and permissions, the Axia admin panel includes a user management interface. Here any user with the admin flag can create, edit and update permissions for users.</p>
<p>Axia currently supports four authentication options:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Local: Users are created inside the Axia admin panel and log in with their credentials.</li>
<li>OAuth2: Users are forwarded to an OAuth2 identity provider, authenticate with it and are returned to Axia to log in via OpenID Connect.</li>
<li>LDAP: Users are regularly imported from an LDAP source (often Active Directory). During login, their credentials are checked live against the LDAP.</li>
<li>Public: Users log into Axia with a pre-defined URL.</li>
</ol>
<p>Regardless of authentication, each user requires a unique name. This can be anything from names to email addresses to personnel numbers.</p>
<p>To manage access to applications, roles are assigned to users. Role permissions are cumulative - the more roles the more access a user has.</p>
<p>Role assignment can be done manually by admin users in the internal user management - or automatically via role mapping when users are originating from outside Axia:</p>
<ul>
<li>OAuth2: Roles can be mapped based on the contents of a claim in the users´ ID token.</li>
<li>LDAP: Roles can be mapped to group memberships of the authenticating user. In Microsoft Active directory, nested groups are supported as well as automatic user deactivation in Axia when the LDAP user account is disabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>MFA (multi-factor authentication) in the form of TOTP (time-based one-time-passwords) is available to users for local &amp; LDAP authentication. MFA can be setup on multiple devices and is supported by most authenticator apps (anything that supports TOTP). Admin users can reset MFA for users if necessary.</p>
<h1 id="manage-applications">Manage applications</h1>
<p>To get use out of Axia, applications need to be installed; for this the <a href="#maintenance-mode">maintenance mode</a> must be enabled.</p>
<p>Applications are installed via the admin user interface. They can be retrieved from multiple sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Official repository: Pre-installed repository for official Axia applications. Internet access is required to access this online service.
<ul>
<li><img src="en_us_admin_pics/repo.webp" alt="Official repository" /></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Local repository: For organizations running multiple Axia instances and/or needing full control over all releases. A repository can be installed on any Axia instance as it is a Axia application as well.</li>
<li>Manual import of applications: All applications can be imported manually. This is useful for development releases, testing and for applications not released in any repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>Organizations starting with Axia should rely on the official repository, switching to local ones when they scale up or self-developed applications become more prevalent.</p>
<h1 id="backup-and-recovery">Backup and recovery</h1>
<p>To fully recover a Axia instance, these components must be backed up:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Axia database</li>
<li>The Axia configuration file (<code>config.json</code>)</li>
<li>Directories (can be renamed in <code>config.json</code>)
<ul>
<li><code>certificates</code> (used SSL certificates)</li>
<li><code>files</code> (uploaded files)</li>
<li><code>transfer</code> (installed applications)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The integrated backup feature automatically backs up all necessary data, if its enabled in the admin panel and dependencies are <a href="#installation">installed</a>.</p>
<p><img src="en_us_admin_pics/backup.webp" alt="Backups!" /></p>
<p>With larger systems, the integrated backup might not be good enough; it can only create full backups, which are very safe but take more time and disk space than other backup methods. With growing data sets, you might need to consider also using incremental/differential backups; these require more effort and possibly infrastructure and are not part of this documentation.</p>
<h2 id="database">Database</h2>
<p>In any deployment model, a PostgreSQL database is used for Axia. To access the stand-alone, integrated database, use the connection details from the Axia configuration file (<code>config.json</code>) while the Axia service is running. The database is called 'app' by default.</p>
<p>For full backups, we recommend using internal PostgreSQL tools, like <code>pg_dump</code> to backup and <code>pg_restore</code> to recover the database. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>To backup to a directory: pg_dump -h HOSTNAME -p 5432 -U USERNAME -Fd -f TARGETDIR</li>
<li>To recover from a directory: pg_restore -h HOSTNAME -p 5432 --no-owner -U USERNAME -d TARGETDBNAME SOURCEDIR</li>
</ul>
<p>Good practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always backup to a separate network location, in case the system fails completely.</li>
<li>Recoveries of full backups should always run against an empty / new database to make sure that all data can safely be recovered to the backed up state. The recovered database can then be renamed or the Axia configuration file updated to access the recovered database.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="updates">Updates</h1>
<p>There are 2 kinds of updates to be handled - application updates and platform updates. Application updates are more common and serve to expand functionality for Axia applications. These updates can be installed directly from the admin user interface, when the maintenance mode is active. If the updates are received via repository, its a single-click operation. Manual updates must be provided via packaged application files. It is good practice to install updates in testing environments first as looks and behaviour can change between application releases.</p>
<p>Platform updates address the underlying platform software and might be necessary for application updates as well, if these require newer platform features. Because security and stability issues are fixed with platform updates, it is always good to update the platform itself.</p>
<h2 id="platform-updates">Platform updates</h2>
<p>If the graphical installer for Windows is used, an update can be directly started by executing a later version of the installer. The platform service will automatically be restarted.</p>
<p>For Linux servers, stopping the service and overwriting files in the chosen application directory with the latest extractable package is required. Afterwards the service can be restarted.</p>
<p>To update the portable version, stop any running Axia instance and extract the contents of a later portable version into the portable application directory.</p>
<h1 id="preparing-a-new-postgresql-database">Preparing a new PostgreSQL database</h1>
<p>Axia in the <a href="#dedicated">dedicated deployment model</a> requires full permissions to a UTF8 encoded PostgreSQL database. This documentation does not cover installation of PostgreSQL on the operating system of your choice. Once the PostgreSQL service is available however, connect with a PostgreSQL client (like <code>psql</code> or <code>pgAdmin</code>) and make sure that both a user as well as database exists for Axia to use. To create both:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>CREATE ROLE my_rei3_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'MY_STRONG_PW!';</code></li>
<li><code>CREATE DATABASE my_rei3_db WITH OWNER = my_rei3_user TEMPLATE = template0 ENCODING = 'UTF8';</code></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="clustering-and-system-performance">Clustering and system performance</h1>
<p>Axia servers can be clustered to enable more requests and users to be handled at the same time. Before considering clustering, it is important to learn where perceived performance issues are coming from. Axia is built to handle many users concurrently and is also able to use multiple processor cores and more memory to improve performance. Only if the CPU load/memory usage of the Axia service is often very high, clustering multiple Axia servers can make sense.</p>
<p>In most cases, performance issues come from other sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>High database load. When running larger Axia instances, the amount of requests can be too much for the database system. This can be seen by connecting to the database server and looking at its statistics. In this scenario, the Axia service will be idle, while the database is overworked. To improve performance, the database system would need to be upgraded - either with better hardware or with clustering of the database system itself. Note that Axia only supports clustered databases with the <a href="#dedicated">dedicated</a> deployment model. Clustering Axia itself would not improve performance in this case.</li>
<li>Missing or badly used indexes on database relations. This can be seen when connecting to the database server and running benchmarks on problematic requests. If indexes are not optimized, the author of the affected application can easily improve performance by updating them. Clustering Axia would not result in any performance improvement in this case.</li>
<li>Slow storage. Either the database system or Axia itself is accessing slow storage systems. This can be seen, when both the Axia application service and database system have very little load but requests still take a long time. In this case, improving latency/throughput of the underlying storage system will have the most impact on performance. Clustering Axia servers would not help.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is the Axia service actually the bottleneck, clustering can help - for this, the following requirements must be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>Axia must be running in <a href="#dedicated">dedicated</a> deployment mode, meaning the database system must be separate from Axia itself. Switching from <a href="#stand-alone">stand-alone</a> deployment to dedicated is always possible.</li>
<li>Axia servers must access the same storage location for their file paths.</li>
<li>Axia servers must access the same database.</li>
<li>It does NOT matter, whether Axia servers are running on different operating systems or processor architectures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting up clustering itself is very simple:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The first Axia server is by default already part of a one-server cluster, with itself as the cluster master. Nothing needs to be done here.</li>
<li>To add additional server nodes, install Axia on other servers and use the same database and file path settings in the Axia configuration file <code>config.json</code>.
<ul>
<li>The file paths for the entire cluster must point to the same storage location - usually networks shares work well for this requirement.</li>
<li>Choose any configuration in the 'web' part of the configuration file that fits with your infrastructure (which port to use, how certificate files are named, etc.).</li>
<li>The <code>cluster/nodeId</code> must be left empty for new server nodes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>As soon as a new server node connects to the existing Axia database, it will register itself as a new cluster node and assigns itself a unique node ID.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the entire setup. The cluster auto-configures and also automatically assigns cluster master role and tasks depending on which nodes are checking in.</p>
<h1 id="cloud-operations">Cloud operations</h1>
<p>Axia can be made accessible on the internet by opening up corresponding firewall ports. We, the Axia manufacturers, aim to make the platform as secure as possible. As with any other application, it is always possible that undiscovered security flaws are exploited and unauthorized access achieved. Besides regularly updating Axia itself, it is our view that additional safety measures are necessary to safely run web applications in the cloud, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Running intrusion detection and prevention on the application server or firewalls</li>
<li>Applying hardening principles to cloud application servers</li>
<li>Using a DMZ to separate cloud accessible services from any local, protected networks</li>
</ul>
<p>The Axia platform does include bruteforce protection; as these are only a small subset of possible attacks, they cannot be relied upon alone for safe, cloud-connected operation. Additional actions (as described above) should be taken in all cases.</p>
